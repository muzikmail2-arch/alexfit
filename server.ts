Hello! I am your **AlexFitnessHub AI Fitness Coach**. I see that you have a fitness goal of **${goal || "General Health"}**. 

To help you succeed, here is a professional, personalized blueprint:

#### 🏃‍♂️ Training Recommendations
- **Primary Style:** Focus on structured strength training integrated with cardio sessions.
- **Chest & Shoulders:** Complete bench pressing and dumbbell flyes to expand target metrics.

#### 🍊 Personalized Nutrition & Fruit Guide
- **Calorie Target:** Approx. **${currentWeight ? Number(currentWeight) * 30 : 2200} kcal/day** to support body recomposition.
- **Optimal Foods:** Clean proteins (chicken breast, fish, eggs, tofu) paired with complex carbs (sweet potatoes, oats).
- **Recommended Fruits:** Strawberries, blueberries, and apples for rich fiber & natural antioxidants.
- **Hydration:** Aim for 3.5 liters of water daily.

(Note: "Easier Alternative" means make the set volume and calorie restrictions 20% lower/easier. "Intensify Training" means increase sets, reps, or calorie targets to speed up growth/adaptation. "Normal" means keep it calibrated standard).

Generate meals incorporating regional foods suitable for their region (${profile.countryRegion || "Nigeria"}) and dietary archetype. Avoid allergens specified in food allergies.
Provide specific customized weightlifting/calisthenics exercises list that fully adapts around their injuries (e.g., if knee pains are listed, absolutely do not recommend barbell depth squats; provide a safe hamstrings replacement instead).

### 🍎 The Power of Eating Natural Meals
Eating natural, unprocessed meals (whole foods like lean animal proteins, unrefined tubers, leafy greens, nuts, and clean water) is paramount for metabolic health. Processed foods are packed with inflammatory trans fats, artificial sodium, and hidden sugars that trigger insulin spikes, promote visceral fat storage, and degrade physical recovery. By eating natural meals, your body absorbs bioavailable micronutrients and fiber, stabilizing energy levels and supporting optimal muscle growth or fat loss.

---

### 🍋 Cucumber & Lemon Water Hydration Protocol (3-4x Weekly)
Proper hydration is the foundation of peak performance. To maximize your results, implement this hydration protocol **3 to 4 times weekly**:

1.  **The Recipe**: Slice half of a fresh cucumber and one medium organic lemon into thin rounds.
2.  **The Vessel**: Place the slices at the bottom of a **2-liter water pitcher** and fill it with clean filtered water.
3.  **The Steep**: Let it steep in the refrigerator for at least **2 to 4 hours** (or overnight) to allow the active essential oils, vitamin C, and mineral electrolytes to infuse into the water.
4.  **How to Drink**: Drink this refreshing 2-liter infusion throughout the day on your designated protocol days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday). 
5.  **Scientific Benefits**: Cucumber provides natural silica and cooling antioxidants to reduce muscle swelling and bloating. Lemons supply high concentrations of citrate and potassium to alkalize the digestive tract and assist liver detoxification. Consuming **2 liters** ensures your cellular mitochondria are fully hydrated to optimize fat burning and muscle protein synthesis!
